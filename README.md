# Poster Image - a TYPO3 extension

When dealing with videos you stream locally (not YouTube etc), you might
want to add a poster image to the video.

Installing this extension does exactly this: You can link to another file
within your extension when editing the metadata of a video file, and choose
a poster image.

## Installation

    composer req b13/poster-image

## Usage

Choose any local video in your file list, and you will see that you can
now choose a poster image when editing the poster image,
which is then rendered in the frontend.

## License

The extension is licensed under GPL v2+, same as the TYPO3 Core. See the LICENSE file.
